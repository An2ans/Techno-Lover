      <h1>Different Types of Techno:</h1>
      <h2>
        Like other music genres, the rise of techno music was also followed by
        its sub-genres birth. Many artists created their own characteristics as
        they want to show people what makes them different. This made them break
        a lot of rules, and that's how sub-genres were born.

      <h2>Some of the types of techno are:</h2>

            <h2>Minimal Techno:</h2>
            <p>
              It is characterized by a stripped-down aesthetic that exploits the
              use of repetition and understated development. Minimal techno is
              thought to have been originally developed in the early 1990s by
              Detroit-based producers Robert Hood and Daniel Bell. My favourite
              representative of this sub-genre is Boris Brejcha.

            <h2>Acid Techno:</h2>
            <p>
              Acid techno, sometimes known generally as "acid", is a genre of
              techno that was derived from acid house and developed in Europe in
              the late 1980s to early 1990s. It saw younger artists apply the
              "squelching" synthesizer sound of Chicago acid house to
              harder-edged techno material. Early exponents of the style
              included Richie Hawtin (aka Plastikman), Aphex Twin, Dave Clarke,
              Hardfloor, solarquest, and Damon Wilde.

            <h2>Industrial Techno:</h2>
            <p>
              Industrial techno is a subgenre of techno and industrial dance
              music that originated in the 1990s. Characteristically, it
              incorporates influences from the bleak, noisy sound and aesthetics
              of early industrial music acts, particularly Cabaret Voltaire and
              Throbbing Gristle. The genre has seen a resurgence in the 2010s
              and it has gained a significant fanbase from the post-dubstep
              audience. Some artists associated with industrial techno are
              Helena Hauff, Surgeon, Blawan, Jeff Mills, etc.

            <h2>Ambient Techno:</h2>
            <p>
              Ambient techno (sometimes also called intelligent techno) is an
              offshoot of techno that united the atmospheric textures of ambient
              music with the rhythmic elements and production of techno and
              house. It was pioneered by 1990s electronic artists such as Aphex
              Twin, Carl Craig, Pete Namlook and Biosphere.

            <h2>Hardcore Techno:</h2>
            <p>
              Hardcore is rooted in the 1970s and early 1980s industrial music,
              specifically the elements of hard electronic dance music.It is
              distinguished by faster tempos and a distorted sawtooth kick (160
              to 200 BPM or more), the intensity of the kicks and the
              synthesized bass (in some subgenres), the rhythm and the
              atmosphere of the themes (sometimes violent), the usage of
              saturation and experimentation close to that of industrial dance
              music.
