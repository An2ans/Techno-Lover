    <!-- WHAT IS TECHNO?  -->

    <section class="whatIsTechno" id="whatIsTechno">
      <h1>What is Techno?</h1>
      <div class="block1">
        <p>Techno is a type of dance music performed with electronic instruments, evolved out of German electro-pop and American house music in the 1970s and 1980s. Techno music is typically characterized by:
          Early synthesizers and drum machines, repetitive & danceable beats (The majority of techno music is in 4/4 time and played at a tempo ranging from 120 bpm to 150 bpm), and a looping bassline and drumbeat, over which a producer may add synth pads, diatonic melodies, or samples.</p>
        <img alt="Depeche Mode, one of the top German electro-pop bands that adopted synth sounds" src="images/depechemode.jpg" />
      </div>
      <div class="block2">
        <p>By the late 1980s, Michigan residents Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson formed a collective known as the Belleville Three. Music historians sometimes credit Atkins with the first true techno song, 1985's "No UFO's." 
        They helped establish a Detroit sound that caught on in Europe. Techno continued to thrive in Detroit thanks to the Underground Resistance music collective, formed in 1989 by "Mad" Mike Banks, Jeff Mills, and Robert Hood. Other techno capitals around the world included New York, Chicago, Berlin, Manchester, etc. </p>

      <div class="block3">
        <p>Today's ravers dance to a wide array of electronic music. Techno spawned many subgenres including minimal techno, ambient techno, hardcore techno, industrial techno, intelligent dance music (IDM), Detroit techno, trance, deep techno, and tech house. From these subgenres came offshoots like acid house, rave, electronica, and EDM. </p>

            <div class="carousel-caption ">
              <h5>1 - I Hate Models</h5>
              <p>He is my number 1 not only because his music quality is top, but also for his talent on visual effects and set composition. You just need to check some of his sets on Youtube, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_EmuZyhqMU&t=3062s" target="_blank">1NN3RT1ME</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUmPGjt0Rz0&t=4324s" target="_blank">Sequences</a> to see what I am talking about.  </p>

            <div class="carousel-caption ">
              <h5>2 - Ellen Allien</h5>
              <p>She is one of the most iconic artists of her generation, a perfect example of German Pop songs influence in Techno. Her music is best described as a blend of IDM and Techno music, which makes her music very danceable! You can enjoy her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTSYJL2jZEU&t=10s" target="_blank" >"balcony sessions"</a>, among others, on Youtube</p>
            </div>

            <div class="carousel-caption ">
              <h5>3 - Héctor Oaks</h5>
              <p>Héctor Oaks, also DJ Kaos, is well known for his stamina and mixing skills, but it is his selection that truly stands out. What seems eclectic on the first sight, is a well-curated mix of vinyl gems. Héctor Oaks seeks for the sweet spot between tracks that are connected not by genre but vibe and style. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTcAdNWqR_s&t=668s" target="_blank">Boiler Room set</a> is a good place to start discovering him.</p>
            </div>

          <div class="carousel-item">
            <img src="images/borisb.jpg" class="d-block w-100" alt="Boris Brejcha">
            <div class="carousel-caption ">
              <h5>4 - Boris Brejcha</h5>
              <p>He is the king of minimal! Some of his songs, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqaOWgHIO0s" target="_blank">The Angel in the Sky</a>, are absolute masterpieces. His low-tempo music with very intense melodies are perfect for studying, travelling, etc. His set at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqz8c4ZP3Wg&t=745s" target="_blank">Grand Palais </a> in Paris is a good start, however, I recommend listening all his songs.</p>

            <img src="images/ninak2.webp" class="d-block w-100" alt="Nina Kraviz">
            <div class="carousel-caption ">
              <h5>5 - Nina Kraviz</h5>
              <p>Her style mixes tech-house, minimal, and acid with excellent results. You can listen her sets on Youtube, like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFvqo1dil7M&t=4s" target="_blank">Tour Eiffel</a> in Paris, or playing Cyberpunk 2077 since she composed some groovy tracks for the game. But I really recommend to listen her live in a gig or festival, there is a huge difference! </p>
